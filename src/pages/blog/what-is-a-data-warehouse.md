### In a nutshell

Data Warehouse is basically a database or a storage of data. However, because a data warehouse is designed mainly for analytical purposes, it must be fast and scalable. That's why it's a bit different from the transactional databases.

### Why do we need a Data Warehouse?

Because a typical cloud data warehouse today has a columnar based structure for storing the data that makes it reading massive amount of data super fast. Unlike the row based structure of a typical database management system that is designed primarily for transactional purposes.
