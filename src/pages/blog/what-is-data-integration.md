### In a nutshell

Data integration is a process of data ingestion then data transformation or in technical terms, it is also known as ELT (extract, load & transform). Though nowadays, some still refer to data integration as ETL (extract, transform & load) because that's how it was done back in the day (due to expensive data warehouse).
